e# Giftr™

Welcome to Giftr™! Please build out the following features **without persistence**. We'll just be focusing on DOM CRUD without persisting any changes to a server.

- In `src/giftData.js` is all the gift data. Build out the following features:

  <!-- - A user should be able to see all of the gift data on initial page load -->
  - A user should be able to search for and filter particular gifts with names that _include_ a particular search query.
  <!-- - A user should be able to create a particular gift. -->
  <!-- - A user should be able to delete a particular gift. -->
  - A user (any user, don't worry about authorization) should be able to edit a gift's details.
